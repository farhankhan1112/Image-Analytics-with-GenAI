# Image-Analytics-with-GenAI
- This project is a simple Streamlit web application that allows users to upload an image and ask a question about it using **Google Gemini 
 AI**, a powerful **Large Language Model (LLM)**. The Gemini 1.5 Flash model processes both text prompts and image inputs (multimodal) to 
 generate intelligent and context-aware responses. This makes the application an example of GenAI + LLM-powered image analytics.

# Features
- Upload an image (PNG, JPG, JPEG).
- Enter a text prompt for analyzing the image.
- Uses **Google Gemini AI** to provide insights based on the image and prompt.

# Project Interface :
- Interactive chat interface
- Easy to Use

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Upload an Image
- The user uploads an image (PNG, JPG, JPEG) by:
- Dragging and dropping it, or
- Clicking the Browse Files button.

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Enter a Text Query
- Who is that actor?

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Powered Response Generation
- The AI analyzes the image and the question together.
- Based on the visual and text input, the AI generates a response like:
- That's Shah Rukh Khan. He's a very famous Indian actor, often referred to as "King Khan" in Bollywood.

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Response Display
- The response is displayed on the Streamlit web page below the image.
- The user can see both the image and the response in one place.

# üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Python ‚Äì For backend logic and API integration

- Streamlit ‚Äì To create a simple and interactive web app UI

- Google Generative AI (Gemini API) ‚Äì A Large Language Model (LLM) used for multimodal content generation (text + image)

- Pillow (PIL) ‚Äì For handling image input and processing

- Gemini 1.5 Flash ‚Äì A multimodal LLM from Google, used to generate responses based on text and images


# Set Up API Key  
You need a **Google Gemini API Key** to use this application. Replace the `api_key` variable in `app.py` with your own API key.

# Run the Application
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

# License

# **Notes**
- Ensure your API key is **valid and active**.
- The Gemini model supports multimodal inputs, so make sure you pass **both** the image and the text correctly.
